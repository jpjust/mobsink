- Dynamic traffic control: the user may specify the traffic for a day and
  make it repeat every following day.
- PanelNetwork::SaveXML doesn't save traffic and blocked data yet.
- It seems that when a sensor has RL > 0 but no connectivity, it keeps
  generating data (that's OK) and flushes all the data at once when it gets
  connectivity (that's not OK).
- Use threads to improve speed in multi-threaded architectures and avoid gray
  scren in Ubuntu (maybe on thread per cluster)
- Allow sinks programming in XML file (enable/disable sinks, move sinks, etc.)
- Move sensors energy parameters from Node.h to network XML file
- BUG: When there is only one sensor transmitting data and more than one sink,
  all sinks move to the same position.
